# SSP World

## Introduction

College courses resources have always been overwhelming, there is too much links and too much drives that is so hard to keep
track of and most of the time we don't even know where to start. As a student in engineering field I've decided to create this
application for the **(Scientific Specalized Programs)** Department to help them maintain a clean professional way of 
communicating and never miss a deadline.
